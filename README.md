# Ember-data-query-path

This mixin makes it easy for users of Ember Data to issue GET requests to urls that don't follow a predictable format 
(For example: `/posts/recent` or `/users/current`). It is common for web APIs with complex queries to implement the query entirly on the server side and expose the result set at its own API endpoint. This plugin gives users an easy way to specify a custom `path` needed to make request to these query endpoints.

## Requirements
* Ember >= 1.13.0
* Ember Data >= 1.13.0
* Ember CLI

## Installing

* ember-cli >= 0.2.3 `ember install ember-data-query-path`

## Upgrading

Please clear `node_modules` and `bower_components` before reporting issues after upgrading.

## Usage

To setup the plugin you must mix it into your store service.
```js
// app/services/store.js
import DS from 'ember-data';
import QueryPath from 'ember-data-query-path/mixins/query-path';

export default DS.Store.extend(QueryPath);
```

Then you can use `queryPath` and `queryPathRecord` methods on your store.

#### `Store#queryPath`
`queryPath` can be used to make a request a path that is expected to return an array of results.

```js
{
  /**
   `store.queryPath` will make a request to the findAll url for the type + the `path` argument provided as the 2nd parameter.
   A optional query object can be provided as the 3rd parameter. This method assumes your api will return an array of records as its response.

   This method is asynchronaous.

   @method queryPath
   @param {String} type
   @param {String} path
   @param {Object} query
   @return {Promise}
  */
  queryPath: function(type, path, query),
}
```

##### Example

```js
// app/routes/my-route.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    // request to /posts/recent?include=comments
    return this.store.queryPath('post', 'recent', { include: 'comments' });
  }
});
```

#### `Store#queryRecordPath`

`queryRecordPath` can be used to make a request a path that is expected to return an a single record.

```js
{
  /**
   `store.queryRecordPath` will make a request to the findAll url for the type + the `path` argument provided as the 2nd parameter.
   A optional query object can be provided as the 3rd parameter. This method assumes your api will return a single record as its response.

   This method is asynchronaous.

   @method queryRecordPath
   @param {String} type
   @param {String} path
   @param {Object} query
   @return {Promise}
  */
  queryRecordPath: function(type, path, query),
}
```

##### Example

```js
// app/routes/my-route.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    // request to /users/current?include=permissions
    return this.store.queryRecordPath('user', 'current', { include: 'permissions' });
  }
});
```

The urls generated by `queryPath` and `queryPathRecord` will be prefixed by any `host` and `namespace` properties you set on your adapter. If the `path` parameter starts with a `/`, Ember Data will treat this as a absolute url and will not prefix it with the adapter `namespace` or the record type. If the record starts with `//` or `http`, Ember Data will treat this as a fully qualified url and will not prefix it with the adapter's `host` property.
